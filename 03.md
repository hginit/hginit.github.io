  One of the biggest benefits of Mercurial is that you can
  use private clones to try experiments and develop new
  features… if they don't work out, you can
  reverse them in a second.

Mercurial lets you experiment freely. Imagine that during the course of normal editing, you get into trouble with your editor and do something catastrophic:

Gotta love emacs. Anyway, all is not lost. The most common way to recover from these things is just to **hg revert** them:

{% include cheat.html 
 top="-65"
 command="hg revert" 
 text="revert changed files back to committed version"
%}

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes> </span><kbd>hg revert guac</kbd>
</samp></pre>

That'll put the files back exactly the way they were at the time of the last commit. Mercurial doesn't like to delete anything, so instead of zapping the [Pig Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin) recipe, it renamed it:

There's a command called **hg rollback** which will save your skin, but only if you haven't pushed this change to anyone else. It only undoes __one__ commit.

Imagine you want to do a major experiment on the side. Your boss hired a new designer, Jim, and lately the specs you've been getting from him are just absurd. There's fluorescent green text, nothing lines up (for &#8220;artistic&#8221; reasons), and the usability is awful. You want to come in one weekend and redo the whole thing, but you're afraid to commit it because you're not really 100% sure that your ideas are better than this nutty graphic designer. Jim is basically smoking a joint from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed. You don't want to hold that against him, and everybody else thinks that it's nobody's business as long as his designs are good, but really, there's a limit. Right? And his designs aren't good. Plus he's kind of offensive.

With Mercurial, you can just make an experimental clone of the entire repository:

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes> </span><kbd>cd ..</kbd>

C:\Users\joel&gt; <strong>hg clone recipes recipes-experiment</strong>
updating to branch default
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
</samp></pre>

This isn't as inefficient as it seems. Because both **recipes** and **recipes-experiment** share all their history (so far), Mercurial will use a file system trick called &#8220;hard links&#8221; so that the copy can be created very quickly, without taking up a lot of extra space on disk.

Now we can make a bunch of changes in the experimental branch:

<pre><samp>
C:\Users\joel&gt; <strong>cd recipes-experiment</strong>
</samp></pre>

Here's my grand guacamole experiment:

<section class="diff">
<h3>a.txt</h3>
<p>
…<br>
Smoosh all ingredients together.<br>
Serve with potato chips.<br>

<ins>This recipe is really good served with QUESO.<br><br>

QUESO is Spanish for "cheese," but in Texas,
it's just Kraft Slices melted in the microwave
with some salsa from a jar. MMM!</ins>
</p>
</section>

Here in the experimental repository, we can commit freely.

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes-experiment> </span><kbd>hg com -m "Queso = Cheese!"</kbd>
</samp></pre>

You can make changes and work freely, committing whenever you want. That gives you all the power of source control even for your crazy experiment, without infecting anyone else.

If you decide that the experiment was misguided, you can just delete the whole experimental directory. Problem solved. It's gone.

But if it worked, all you have to do is push your new changes:

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes-experiment>  </span><kbd>hg push</kbd>
pushing to c:\Users\joel\recipes
searching for changes
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files
</samp></pre>

Where did they go?

{% include cheat.html top=0
command="hg paths"
text="shows a list of known remote repositories "
%}

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes-experiment>  </span><kbd>hg paths</kbd>
default = c:\Users\joel\recipes
</samp></pre>

The &#8220;default&#8221; entry there shows you the path to the repository that **hg push** will push changes to, if you don't specify any other repository. Normally, that's the repository that you cloned off of. In this case, it's a local directory, but you could also have a URL there.

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes-experiment> </span><kbd>cd ..\recipes</kbd>
</samp></pre>

Don't forget, just because the change has been pushed into this __repository__…

See? That &#8220;Queso&#8221; stuff is in changeset 5. But my main repository was working off of changeset 4, and just because someone pushed new changes into the __repository__, doesn't mean they've showed up in my working directory yet, so I'm still working off of changeset 4.

If I want to see what's in changeset 5, I have to use the **hg update** command:

See what happened here? The changes came in, but they were on top of the version I was working on. <strong>push</strong> and <strong>pull</strong> just send changes from one repo to another&#8212;they don't affect the files I'm working on at the moment.

Right now here's the state of repositories:


![](i/03-repo-2.png)


Mercurial is flexible about moving changes around from repository to repository. You can push straight from the experimental repository into the central repository:

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes> </span><kbd>cd ..\recipes-experiment</kbd>

<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes-experiment> </span>

</samp></pre>

That pushed change 5 from the experimental repo directly into the central repository. Now, if I go back to my repository, there's nothing left to push!

<pre><samp>
<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes-experiment> </span><kbd>cd ..\recipes</kbd>

<span class=prompt>C:\Users\joel\recipes> </span><kbd>hg out</kbd>
comparing with http://joel.example.com:8000/
searching for changes
no changes found
</samp></pre>

That's because Mercurial knows that the central repo already got this particular changeset from somewhere else. That's really useful, because otherwise it would try to apply it again, and it would be massively confused.

After they made a job offer to designer Jim, he said he would start work right away, but then he didn't show up for two months. People had mostly forgotten about him and about the job offer, and when he showed up at the office for the first time to start work, looking rather sunburned, to be honest, nobody quite knew who he was or what was going on. It was pretty funny. He is kind of a generic looking guy. Eventually they figured it out, but since he was new, nobody had the guts to ask him what the hell had happened. Just like they never ask him about the bruises and scratches on his face. Whatever. We hate that guy.

Sometimes it may happen that you discover that, months earlier, you made a mistake.

Potato chips? WTF?!

Mercurial can backout an old changeset from the past for you. It looks at the changeset, figures out the __opposite__, and does that to your current working directory. Let's try backing out that old revision 2.

Now, a lot of time may have passed. The chips might already be gone from the recipe. All kinds of spooky stuff might have happened that makes it impossible to merge in this change. In that case, you’re going to get merge conflicts, which you’re going to have to resolve somehow. We’ll talk about that in the next tutorial.

## Test yourself

Here are the things you should know how to do after reading this tutorial:

1. Revert accidental changes, before and after checking in
2. Clone a repository locally for experiments
3. Push between repositories
4. Revert an old mistake that’s been in the repository for ages
