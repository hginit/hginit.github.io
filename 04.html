description: >
   Sometimes merges cause conflicts. Usually they’re easy to fix,
   but you do need to resolve them or you’ll have multiple heads.
   And who wants multiple heads?

<p>An important part of version control is coordinating the work of multiple people on the same code base.</p>

<p>Imagine that Rose and I both want to make a change to the guacamole recipe. Rose is improving the avocado quality. Before she starts, she&#8217;s going to pull all the latest changes from the central repository so that she&#8217;s totally up to date.</p>

<p>I have &#8220;multiple heads.&#8221; Essentially, my repository looks like this:</p>


<img src="i/04-repo.png" />


<p>See the two heads? They came about because when Rose made her change, she was working off of changeset 7, and when I made my change, I was working off of changeset 7, too. So now a merge is needed. [Ed: Never use passive voice!] <em>I need to merge.</em></p>

</samp></pre>

<p>The merge command, <strong>hg merge</strong>, took the two heads and combined them. Then it left the result in my working directory. It did not commit it. That gives me a chance to check that the merge is correct:</p>

<pre class="joel"><samp>
C:\Users\joel\recipes> <strong>type guac</strong>
* 2 ripe Hass avocados (not Haas)
* 1/2 red onion, minced (about 1/2 cup)

* 2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon of fresh lime or lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
* A dash of freshly grated black pepper
* 1/2 ripe tomato, seeds and pulp removed, chopped

Smoosh all ingredients together.
Serve with tortilla chips.

This recipe is really good served with QUESO.

QUESO is Spanish for "cheese," but in Texas,
it's just Kraft Slices melted in the microwave
with some salsa from a jar. MMM!
</samp></pre>

<p>That looks right; the avocados are Hass and the chiles are Jalapenos. So I&#8217;ll go ahead and commit and push that to the server.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pushing two changesets: my original jalapeno change, and then the merge, which is its own changeset.</p>

<p>Notice that nothing about our two changes conflicted, since Rose and I were working on different parts of the recipe. So the merge was super duper easy. That&#8217;s the most common case, because in most organizations, each programmer is assigned to work on a different part of the code.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have a dysfunctional organization where nobody is willing to really put their foot down about who is supposed to work on what. This can cause sudden and often unexplained feelings of sadness among the programming staff. This is hard to detect. Symptoms can include: programmers locking themselves in bathrooms, programmers locking themselves in the server closet, high turnover, muted sobbing sounds in the cube farm, and sudden eardrum trauma caused by the sound of repeated firing of a military-class assault rifle.</p>

<p>BUT, even in the best-managed and healthiest organizations, merge conflicts do sometimes occur, and Mercurial will require the merging person to resolve the conflict. Let&#8217;s see what that looks like.</p>

<p>First&#8230; I want to bring Rose up to speed with my jalapeno changes:</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re going to see what happens when you have a gen-yoo-ine conflict: we&#8217;re both going to muck with the ingredients a bit.</p>

<p>And suddenly, the conflict is detected, and up pops some kind of a graphical merge-conflict-resolution tool, with a user interface that only its mother could love, but they are usually quite good at what they do once you figure it out. A common merge conflict resolution tool these days is KDiff3, which shows Rose the following:</p>


<img src="i/04-kdiff3.png" />


<p>In KDiff3, you see four panes. The top left is the original file. Top center shows Rose her version. Top right shows Rose my version. The bottom pane is an editor where Rose constructs a merged file with the conflicts resolved.</p>

<p>Fixing conflicts is a relatively simple matter of going through each conflict and choosing how to resolve it. Rose goes crazy and decides that Banana Mango Guacamole couldn&#8217;t be that bad:</p>


<img src="i/04-kdiff3-after.png" />


<p>By the way, did I tell you that Rose seems to be dating? The other day she was seen leaving work with a guy that sort-of looked like Dennis Franz. She&#8217;s been in the best mood anyone has seen her in years.</p>

<p>Rose saves her changes and exits KDiff3.</p>

<p>And the conflict is resolved.</p>

<p>One thing you should keep in mind: you do not have to merge on anybody&#8217;s schedule. You can <strong>hg pull</strong> whenever you want, and if you don&#8217;t feel like merging the conflicts, you&#8217;re free to keep working, and committing, happily, until you have time to think about the merge.</p>

<h2>Test yourself</h2>

<p>Here are the things you should know how to do after reading this tutorial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Work on a code base with other people</li>
  <li>Get their changes</li>
  <li>Push your changes</li>
  <li>Resolve merge conflicts that may come up from time to time</li>
  <li>Diagnose certain classes of programmer melancholy</li>
</li>
</ol>
